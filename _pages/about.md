I began my research career at the University of Louisville studying host-pathogen interactions of the anther smut fungus *Microbotryum violaceum* in the lab of Dr. Michael Perlin while obtaining a bachelor's degree in Biology. Now I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics and Genomics in the lab of Jacqueline Payton at Washington University in St. Louis. A self-proclaimed "damp" lab, we study epigenomic and transcriptional deregulation in T and B cell lymphomas through integrated discovery-based 'omics followed by experimental validation and further functional studies in *in vitro* systems. This environment has allowed me to acquire skills from bench to command line - I can generate the data, analyze it, and perform the functional assays to biologically validate the findings.

Outside the lab, I enjoy taking on open-source side projects to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and analysis techniques. I try to learn in the context of creating something useful, which led me to create [Genotify](https://github.com/j-andrews7/Genotify) and contribute to open-source projects like [biopython](https://biopython.org/) and [SingleR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/SingleR.html). Check out my [projects](https://j-andrews7.github.io/projects/) page or [github](https://github.com/j-andrews7) for a comprehensive listing of my current and past projects. I also enjoy college basketball and have written a number of analytical articles about the Louisville Cardinals on [CardChronicle](https://www.cardchronicle.com), a fan site.
