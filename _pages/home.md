I'm Jared Andrews, a Ph.D. candidate in Molecular Genetics and Genomics at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm doing my dissertation work on comparative multi-omics studies of B and T cell lymphomas in the [Payton lab](https://wupathlabs.wustl.edu/payton/). In particular, I'm interested in epigenetic and transcriptomic deregulation in cancer, single cell technologies, complex data visualization, big data, and precision medicine. And college basketball.

This website serves as a portfolio of both my professional and personal projects, along with my publications, casual articles, and miscellaneous other nonsense. Explore at your leisure!
