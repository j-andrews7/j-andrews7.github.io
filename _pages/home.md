I'm Jared Andrews, a Bioinformatics Research Scientist in Suzanne Baker's lab at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, where we study high grade pediatric brain tumors driven by oncogenic histone mutations. I earned my Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics and Genomics at Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked on comparative multi-omics studies of B and T cell lymphomas in the [Payton lab](https://wupathlabs.wustl.edu/payton/). In particular, I'm interested in epigenetic and transcriptomic deregulation in cancer, oncohistones, single cell technologies, interactive data visualization, big data, and precision medicine. And college basketball.

This website serves as a portfolio of both my professional and personal projects, along with my publications, casual articles, and miscellaneous other nonsense. Feel free to contact me about potential collaborations or issues with any projects I'm involved in via Github, Twitter, LinkedIn, or by email using the links to the left. Explore at your leisure!
